#### If you don't have an internet connection on the PC to be installed, you can use [`v3`](https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/tag/v3). , since it still has all runtimes in the installer - update status of [`v3`](https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/tag/v3): April 2022
