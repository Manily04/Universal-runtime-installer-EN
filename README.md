# Visual C++ Runtime and DirectX all in one installer
This installer allows you to install the latest Visual C++ Runtime of all years (2008-2022) and the complete DirectX Runtime in English at once.

## Updates
The [Final](https://github.com/MarcBeast/VC-Runtime-and-DirectX-all-in-one-Installer/releases/latest) version downloads all runtimes independently, i.e. if an update of a runtime is available , the installer will download them automatically. (An internet connection is required for [the Final Release](https://github.com/MarcBeast/VC-Runtime-and-DirectX-all-in-one-Installer/releases/latest))

An internet connection is required for [the Final Release](https://github.com/MarcBeast/VC-Runtime-and-DirectX-all-in-one-Installer/releases/latest).

#### If you do not have an internet connection on the PC to be installed, you can use the [Release](https://github.com/MarcBeast/VC-Runtime-and-DirectX-all-in-one-Installer/releases/tag/v1) version, because it still has all runtimes already in the installer downloaded - update status of the Release version: April 2022
