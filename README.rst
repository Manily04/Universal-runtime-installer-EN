Universal runtime installer
===============================
This installer allows to install the latest Visual C++ Runtime of all years (2008-2022), Full DirectX Runtime, Microsoft XNA Framework, .Net Runtime, Java and OpenAL at once.

updates
===============================
The `latest version <https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/latest>`_ downloads all runtimes independently, which means that when the tool is run, the latest available version of the runtime is always installed. (An internet connection is required for `versions above the first release <https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/tag/v1>`_)

offline setup
===============================
If you don't have an internet connection on the PC to be installed, you can use the `first release <https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/tag/v1>`__ because they still have all Visual Studio 2008 - 2022 Runtimes in the installer, but no more - Update status of `v1 <https://github.com/Manily04/Universal-runtime-installer-EN/releases/tag/v1>`_ - April 2022
